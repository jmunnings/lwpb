 * encoder/decoder
   * issue: cannot assert that required fields are present
   * issue: cannot assert that required/optional fields are not repeated
   * issue: default values are not encoded if field are not present
   * implement packed repeated fields
 * struct map encoder/decoder
   * issue: interleaved repeated fields are not decoded correctly
 * finish test cases
